### Summing Up

The examples in this chapter provide a quick tour of the many types of standard data charts, the simplest and most straightforward tool for visualizing data. Each of these charts is especially effective for certain types of visualizations.

<dl class="dl-horizontal">
  <dt>Bar Charts</dt>
  <dd>The workhorse of charts. Effective at showing the change of a quantity over a small number of regular time intervals, or at comparing several different quantities against each other.</dd>
  <dt>Line Charts</dt>
  <dd>More effective than bar charts when there is a large number of data values to show, or for showing quantities that vary on an irregular schedule.</dd>
  <dt>Pie Charts</dt>
  <dd>Often overused, but can be effective to highlight the percentage of a whole that a single value comprises.</dd>
  <dt>Scatter Charts</dt>
  <dd>Effective for showing possible relationships between two values.</dd>
  <dt>Bubble Charts</dt>
  <dd>Adds a third value to scatter charts, but should be used carefully, as humans have difficulty accurately assessing the relative areas of circular regions.</dd>
  <dt>Radar Charts</dt>
  <dd>Designed to show several aspects of the subject on one chart. Not as familiar to many users, so be aware of the extra difficulty interpretation may entail.</dd>
